Contributed Knack Middleware and Utilities
==========================================

Nothing to see here yet.

Please let me get a project setup with tests inplace, etc.

Once that's setup, contrib should be contributed to by:

 - fork the knack-contrib repository
 - add your middleware (or utility)
 - be sure to add tests (using the conventions that we put in place)
 - add a short description about your middleware to the README
 - send a pull request

For a good example, check out [rack-contrib][].  It's nice and simple and well-organized  :)
